"""Helpers for collections of datasets (shared by the multi-dataset verbs).

Lives in ``gdatastate`` because it is generic plumbing over the container type and is
needed by both ``render`` (``pg.plot(a, b)``) and ``operations`` (``pg.info(a, b)``) --
both of which already depend on ``gdatastate``. Keeping it here avoids duplicating the
flatten in two layers or stranding it in the facade.

  expected). Recursion is on any iterable, not just ``list``/``tuple`` -- this is
  what lets a nested ``gdatastate.gdatastategroup.GDataStateGroup`` flatten correctly without this
  module importing that one (it needs no type check, only that groups are
