"""``GDataGroup`` -- the fluent group container over
``gdatastate.GDataStateGroup``.

Mirrors how :class:`~postgkyl.gdata.gdata.GData` adds the fluent verb methods
on top of the verb-less :class:`~postgkyl.gdatastate.gdatastate.GDataState`: this class
adds *broadcasting* verbs on top of the verb-less
:class:`~postgkyl.gdatastate.gdatastategroup.GDataStateGroup`, without duplicating a single
verb body.

Contract
--------
Any attribute name that is not defined on this class itself (and does not
start with ``_``) is resolved by :meth:`__getattr__`, by looking it up on
every member, in order (**broadcasting**):

- If the attribute is a *verb method* on every member, calling the broadcast
  invokes that method on each member with the same arguments. If every
  member's result is a ``GDataState`` (or subclass), the results are wrapped
  in a *new* group of the caller's own concrete class, so chains stay fluent:
  ``group.interpolate().select(z0=0.0)``. Otherwise -- a terminal verb whose result is
  not a dataset (``.write()`` -> one path per member, full ``.integrate()`` ->
  one value per member, ``.extract_input()`` -> one string per member, ...)
  -- a plain ``list`` of the per-member results is returned, in member order.
- If the attribute is a *non-callable* value on every member (a property such
  as ``num_dims`` or ``backend``), it resolves immediately to a plain
  ``list`` of the per-member values, in member order -- no closure, no
  call needed.
- Attribute names starting with ``_`` are never broadcast (raises
  ``AttributeError``), so private/dunder probes and pickling machinery are
  unaffected. An attribute missing from any member also raises
  ``AttributeError`` immediately, at access time.

The explicit methods below either combine/reorder the members or have
collection-wide terminal semantics. In particular, ``plot`` draws every
member on one figure, so a multiblock family remains one physical field.
``plotly`` is still an ordinary per-dataset verb and therefore broadcasts.

``operations.grid`` has no fluent spelling anywhere (not on ``GData``, so not
broadcast here either) -- see ``api/gdata.py`` for why.

``load`` is also explicit rather than broadcast: it is the group's lifecycle
method, appending newly loaded member(s) to this group and returning ``self``
so an initially empty group can be assembled fluently.
