  """Reorder datasets by the natural/numeric sort of their source filename.

  Fixes the shell-glob/lexicographic-sort trap where ``field_10.gkyl`` sorts
  before ``field_2.gkyl``: digit runs embedded in the filename are compared
  as integers rather than character-by-character, so frame files come out in
  increasing frame order regardless of digit-count padding (see
  ``numerics.natural_sort_key``).

  Accepts ``sort(a, b)`` or ``sort([a, b])`` (flattened via
  ``gdatastate.flatten_datasets``). No dataset is copied or mutated -- only
  the returned list's order differs from the input.

  Args:
    *datasets: the datasets to reorder, or lists/groups thereof.
    reverse: sort in decreasing order instead of increasing.

  Returns:
    The same datasets, reordered by their source filename's natural sort key.
