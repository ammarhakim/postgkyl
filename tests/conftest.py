"""Shared pytest configuration for the postgkyl test suite.

No-GUI guarantee
-----------------
This test session must never put a window or a browser tab on the desktop --
doing so can crash/hang the sandboxed environment this suite runs in. Two
independent guards enforce that, both applied before any test module (or its
imports) can run:

- ``matplotlib.use("Agg")`` is forced at import time, below, before anything
  else gets a chance to trigger Matplotlib's own backend auto-detection
  (which, given a display, could pick an interactive GUI backend). Agg is a
  pure-raster, no-window backend, so ``plt.show()`` is always a no-op under it.
- ``_block_gui_popups`` (autouse, session-scoped) monkeypatches
  ``webbrowser.open`` -- the mechanism ``render.plotly``'s ``open_preview``
  (default-off; see its docstring) uses to show a Plotly figure -- and, if
  PyVista is installed, ``pyvista.Plotter.show`` -- the analogous mechanism
  for a PyVista render window (see ``render.pyvista.pyvista``'s ``no_show``
  parameter). Plotly defaults ``show`` to ``False``; interactive-by-default
  PyVista calls in tests pass ``no_show=True``. This fixture is the backstop
  for any call that forgets to select its renderer's headless setting.

Test data generation
--------------------
``pytest_configure`` writes synthetic .gkyl files to
``tests/test_data/generated/`` (gitignored -- every test that reads from
that directory depends on this running first). It is a hook, not a
session-scoped autouse fixture, specifically so it runs exactly once in the
true parent process before collection or any forking begins -- see its own
comment for why a fixture is the wrong tool once macOS CI's --forked is in
play. Without it, a clean checkout (e.g. CI) has no fixtures to read; only a
machine where someone has run ``python tests/generate_test_data.py`` (or a
prior pytest session) before would happen to have them already on disk.

# test and printed its full (passing) summary. Nothing of value happens in
